The summoned unit must be set up wholly within 9\" of this model and more than 9\" from any enemy units. That unit cannot move in the following movement phase. Choose a unit from the following list: 20 Dryads, 10 Tree-Revenants, 10 Spite-Revenants, 3 Kurnoth Hunters, 1 Branchwych, 1 Treelord"

None of the woods can be set up within 1\" of any other models or terrain features. "
